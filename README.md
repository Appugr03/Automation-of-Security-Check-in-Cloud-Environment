Zero Trust Security Dashboard – Security Overview
The Security Overview page serves as the central hub for real-time monitoring of cloud infrastructure using Zero Trust principles. It displays a dynamic Security Metrics Dashboard with a current Security Score (e.g., 85%) representing the overall security posture of the system. The interface also shows trends and improvements compared to previous assessments (e.g., "+2% vs last week").
The sidebar provides quick access to key modules such as:
Services – Microservice insights
Network – Network traffic and segmentation
Threats – Detected anomalies or risks
Access Control – Role and permission enforcement
Monitoring & Activity – User and system logs
Users – Identity-based access tracking
The sleek, dark-themed UI with real-time status indicators (e.g., “System Secure”) enhances clarity and usability for security analysts and admins.

Global Cyber Threat Monitor – Dashboard Overview
The Global Cyber Threat Monitor provides a real-time visual representation of cyber threat activity across different regions. It highlights:

🔥 462 Active Threats currently being tracked

🚨 3 Critical Alerts indicating high-severity issues

🌍 8 Affected Regions across the globe

The heatmap visually clusters threat zones based on severity, with color-coded intensity:

🔴 Red: High-threat regions (e.g., 120, 95 threats)

🟠 Orange/Yellow: Moderate to low-level threat clusters

🟡 Yellow: Low-threat or emerging activity

This interface empowers security teams with rapid situational awareness, enabling them to prioritize responses, monitor threat density by geography, and take immediate mitigation steps based on real-time analytics.
