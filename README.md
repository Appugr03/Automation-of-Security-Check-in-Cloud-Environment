Zero Trust Security Dashboard – Security Overview
The Security Overview page serves as the central hub for real-time monitoring of cloud infrastructure using Zero Trust principles. It displays a dynamic Security Metrics Dashboard with a current Security Score (e.g., 85%) representing the overall security posture of the system. The interface also shows trends and improvements compared to previous assessments (e.g., "+2% vs last week").

The sidebar provides quick access to key modules such as:

Services – Microservice insights

Network – Network traffic and segmentation

Threats – Detected anomalies or risks

Access Control – Role and permission enforcement

Monitoring & Activity – User and system logs

Users – Identity-based access tracking

The sleek, dark-themed UI with real-time status indicators (e.g., “System Secure”) enhances clarity and usability for security analysts and admins.
